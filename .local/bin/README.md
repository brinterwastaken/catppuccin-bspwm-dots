# `~/.local/bin`
I'd recommend adding this directory to your path.
Add `export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"` to `~/.zshrc` or `~/.profile`

## `~/.local/bin/fetcher`
Displays system information sort of like neofetch.
It is an edited version of the fetch tool in chadwm.
(Make sure it's executable with `chmod +x ~/.local/bin/fetcher` for it to run)
